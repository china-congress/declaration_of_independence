# Declaration of termination of individual and civil rights default authorization

From birth, God has endowed every
human being with a number of inalienable
individual rights, including the right to life,
the right to liberty, the right to non-removal
of organs, the right to the pursuit of
happiness and the right to freedom from
fear, the possession of which is the mark
of man and slave, and before which all are
equal.

Naturally, when citizenship takes effect, it
is accompanied by a number of
inalienable civil rights, including the right to
participate and exercise them. The
possession of these rights is what
distinguishes a citizen from a resident, and
every citizen is equal before the rights of
citizenship.

As a matter of course, a state is a political
entity on a piece of land, and a state can
legally become several states
independently, or several states can legally
merge into one state.

It is clear that the citizen is the owner of
power, and the government is a delegate
of power, a representative organization
created by the citizen's authority; the
authority of the government is under the
rights of the individual and the rights of the
citizen; the work of the government is to
provide services to the people as
requested by the citizen, and the results of
the work are subject to the citizen's
supervision; the staff of the government is
rewarded for providing services.


So it can be determined that：

1. Laws enacted by the authority of the
citizens shall not conflict with the rights of
individuals and citizens, and shall be
considered null and void in any case of
conflict.

2. All laws that have been reviewed and
put into effect by citizens must be obeyed
by every one, and it is more important for
the government to obey the law than for
individuals to obey the law.

3. The people create wealth through their
labor and support the government by
means of taxes.

However, in this ancient la nd of China,
since ancient times, these rights have
either been ignored and forgotten by the
people or granted to the government by
default. If the government that gets the
power can guarantee the people's
security, recovering these man dates is not
urge nt and important; if the government
not only fails to guarantee the people's
security, but increasingly harshly harms
them, recovering these man dates is not
only urge nt and important, it is natural and
righteous!

The following is my understanding of
the situation.

1. The right to life is not guaranteed in this
land. Power is used to kill people outright,
or to protect those who kill, or to force
people to commit suicide, or to prevent
people from protecting their own lives, in a
myriad of ways.

2. In this land, the right to freedom is not
guaranteed. Freedom of speech, freedom
of thought, freedom of movement,
freedom of belief, have all been severely
curtailed to the point of total deprivation,
which is getting worse.

3. In this land, the right not to move organs
is desecrated. Whether a person is alive or
dead, he or she does not have the right to
trade his or her organs, let alone the
organs of others; here the price is clearly
marked, and God is outraged.

4. In this land, the right to pursue
happiness is not guaranteed. The
inviolability of private property is the basic
guarantee of the pursuit of happiness.

5. In this land, the right to be free from fear
is not guaranteed. Power is not supervised
and ensures that the people are always
afraid, unthinkable.

6. In this land, the right to participation of
citizens is not guaranteed. The people's
representatives are all internalized, and
individuals are arrested for running for
office, as witnessed time and again.

7. In this land, the exercise of citizens'
rights is not guaranteed. When citizens
want to exercise their constitutional rights
to freedom of speech, freedom of belief,
freedom of publication and freedom of
association, they are often prosecuted and
arrested 泊discriminately, which can be
seen everywhere.

8. In a land where power is the only thing
the government wants. Hong Kong, which
already has individual and civil rights, and
the protect!on of international law, the
government destroys this jewel, marking
the power that will never be returned to the
people, ironically!

9. In this land, the government is hostile to
the people, enslaving them and keeping
them in captivity. First Tibet, then Xinjiang,
but also the whole country to promote,
hostile to humanity, hostile to faith, hostile
to facts, hostile to ideas, hostile to records,
hostile to shouting, iron clad!

10, in this land, the courage gradually does
not manifest, hope is increasingly remote,
the people do not resist, the yoke from
generation to generation, stronger and
stronger!

It does not take courage to make the
declaration of the right to reclaim, nor
does it deserve glory, for absolutely
legitimate reasons.
Today, I solemnly swear by the rights and
welfare of future generations, and I prove
by my actions that the following
proclamation is not false.

1. no authorization shall be deemed to
have been obtained from me where such
authorization has not been initiated by me.

2. no authorization shall be deemed to
have been obtained from me where such
authorization was not obtained of my own
free will.

3. that any decision and action taken by a
regime that has not been authorized by
me, in claiming to make any decision and
action on my behalf, is not a decision and
action on my behalf.

4. when my right to freedom is violated,
compare informing the other party that his
or her right is violated, and I regard the
informing as resistance.

5. that no one shall have access to my
organs, even if I am dead, unless I have
authorization to donate them during my
lifetime

6. when I and my family are faced with
unlawful fear, I regard all means of
response as justified.

7. that when I and my family are faced with
an unlawful threat to my life, I will resist to
the fullest extent possible at the cost of my
life.

8. when faced with a collective threat to
my community, I will be the first to
summon the courage to never sit idly by
and will do something about it.

The times are not chosen, the land is as
old as ever.
If I do not make a change, there is no hope
for the happiness of my children and
grandchildren.
If I am killed, please spread my courage,
with my hope, and make it echo!
If this is my last cry, I will cry out.
We are the people, who deserve all the
glory of the world!
